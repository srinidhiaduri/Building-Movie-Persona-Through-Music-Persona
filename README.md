# Building-Movie-Persona-Through-Music-Persona

The idea behind the project is to explore the idea of leveraging in-house data to enable cross-platform data driven recommendation capability. This project helped us explore questions like:

1. Can we use a user's music listening pattern to enhance movie recommendation? Can we establish a relationship between the two?
2. How can I efficiently use my data to make cross-platform decisions?
3. Is there any correlation between a person's movie and music choices? 

The scope of this project for now has been limited to SQL but we aim to make a more robust Exploratory Data Analysis in the future with more comprehensive data.
